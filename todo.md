Backend

Plans
- react multipage website + event listening for the timer
- Change character count to word count (needs some thought put in)
    - Final wordcount
    - Words written (how to record)

- Codemirror to mimic markdown rendering
- Saving + loading your writing
- UI mockup

Ideas
- Renaming battle to something more fun
- Battles give loot drops of words - fridge poetry minigame, possibly on a weekly reset or something
